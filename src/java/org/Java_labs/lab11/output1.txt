In mathematics, Voronoi diagram is partition of plane into regions close
to each of given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are
just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators).



For each seed there is corresponding region, called Voronoi cell,
consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other.
The Voronoi diagram of set of points is dual to that set's Delaunay
triangulation.  word1 word2
